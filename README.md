# Memory Card - The Odin Project 

## [Live preview](https://kyroc.github.io/memory-card/)

## How I worked on this Project
- I built this app following [The Odin Projects Memory Card project requirements](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card)
- Using React functional components and state hooks to create a memory card game

## Learning points
1. I mainly focusced on functional components and state hooks for the logic behind the game
2. Responsive CSS for the card sizes to allow for varying screensizes. 

### Things to update
- Cleaner CSS and a dark theme as well
